# NeuralNet

A simple framework for creating various architectures of NNs. 

This NN solves the famous XOR problem, and is a good test to see whether the NN works properly.

All layers, be it Activation, Dense or otherwise are derrived from the Base layer.

The picture represents how to NN decided to separate the dots from the unit square. 
NOTE: the picture could have been inversed due to the fact that the weights and biases are randomly initialized
